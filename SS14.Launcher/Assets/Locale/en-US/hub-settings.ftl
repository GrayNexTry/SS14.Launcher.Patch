hub-settings-explanation = Here you can add extra hubs to fetch game servers from.
    You should only add hubs that you trust, as they can 'spoof' game
    servers from other hubs. The order of the hubs matters; if two hubs
    advertise the same game server the hub with the higher priority
    (higher in the list) will take precedence.
